What is this?
=============

This is the code repository for the site www.isSeptaFcked.com.  Or, if you 
are a regular commuter on SEPTA: www.isSeptaFucked.com.


Why did you write it?
=====================

This, and many more questions are answered in the FAQ: http://www.isseptafucked.com/faq


How does it work?
=================

Once every minute, it makes an API request for SEPTA's Regional Rail trains.  It then esitmates "fuckedness" as follows:

- All trains < 10 minutes late: Not Fucked
- 1 or more trains >= 10 minutes late and < 30 minutes late: A Little Fucked
- 1 or more trains >= 30 minutes late: Fucked
