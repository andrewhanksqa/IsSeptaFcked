	h2.title API

	h4.faq-question Why did you write an API?
	div.faq-answer
		| I wanted to share the data I generate (determining the 
		| "fuckedness" of trains) with others.  I found a neat way 
		| to use SEPTA's data, and maybe someone else will find a 
		| neat way to use my data.

	h4.faq-question So what are the API endpoints?
	div.faq-answer
		ul
			li 
				a(href="/api/rr") Regional Rail Data
				|  (Includes "fuckedness")
			li 
				a(href="/api/rr/raw_data") Regional Rail Raw Data
				|  (A copy of the data I'm seeing from SEPTA)

	h4.faq-question Are there any restrictions on this data?
	div.faq-answer
		| Please try not to hit the API more than once every few minutes.
